# rvf
For optimizing real-valued functions of several real variables.

## Method

The energy method is simply given by the function provided to the class (or the negative of the function, if a maximum is sought).
The neighbor method picks a random direction, and moves the point by some small amount in that direction (clipping the point if it happens to exit the bounding region).

This example takes advantage of the `format_output` method to reformat the energy when `objective='max'` to actually display the max value, rather than the energy (which is always minimized by the algorithm).

## Usage

```python
from rvf import RvfSolver

solver = RvfSolver(function, initial_state, bounds, objective='min')
solver.anneal(max_steps=max_steps)
```

- `initial_state` must be of the form `[x_1, ..., x_n]`.
- `bounds` must be of the form `[[b_00, b_01], ... [b_n0, b_n1]]`.
- `objective` (optional) must be either `'min'` or `'max'`. Default is `'min'`.


## Examples
To run the example:
```bash
$ python anneal/examples/rvf/rvf_example.py
```

Example output:
```bash
