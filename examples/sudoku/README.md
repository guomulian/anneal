# sudoku
For solving [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) puzzles via simulated annealing.

## Method
(Taken from [here](https://github.com/erichowens/SudokuSolver).)

The puzzle is initialized by randomly filling each 3x3 block with the missing numbers appropriate for that block (making sure to note which cells are unknown, so we can restrict our moves to those cells).

Neighbors are generated by randomly selecting one of the 3x3 blocks, then switching two of the "unknown" cells. (If the block is already filled, it randomly selects one of the other blocks.)

Since the initialization and neighbor selection method guarantee the 3x3 block constraint is satisfied, the energy method only needs to take into account the row and column constraints. We do this by subtracting one from the energy for each unique value in each row and column.

This gives us a best possible score of `-9*9 (rows) + -9*9 (columns) = -162`.

## Usage

```python
from sudoku import SudokuSolver

solver = SudokuSolver(puzzle)
solver.anneal(max_steps=max_steps)
```

`puzzle` must be of the form `[[c_00, ..., c_08], ..., [c_80, ..., c_88]]`, where `c_ij` is a digit from `0-9` (`0` representing an empty cell).

## Examples
To run the example:
```bash
$ python anneal/examples/sudoku/sudoku_example.py
```

Example output:
```bash
# Solving puzzle with max_steps = 1000:
# 0 0 0 2 6 0 7 0 1
# 6 8 0 0 7 0 0 9 0
# 1 9 0 0 0 4 5 0 0
# 8 2 0 1 0 0 0 4 0
# 0 0 4 6 0 2 9 0 0
# 0 5 0 0 0 3 0 2 8
# 0 0 9 3 0 0 0 7 4
# 0 4 0 0 5 0 0 3 6
# 7 0 3 0 1 8 0 0 0
# 
# SOLUTION:
# 4 3 5 2 6 9 7 8 1
# 6 8 2 5 7 1 4 9 3
# 1 9 7 8 3 4 5 6 2
# 8 2 6 1 9 5 3 4 7
# 3 7 4 6 8 2 9 1 5
# 9 5 1 7 4 3 6 2 8
# 5 1 9 3 2 6 8 7 4
# 2 4 8 9 5 7 1 3 6
# 7 6 3 4 1 8 2 5 9
# Final Energy: -162
# Solved correctly!
